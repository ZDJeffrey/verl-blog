verl is a flexible, efficient and production-ready RL training library for large language models (LLMs).

verl is the open-source version of **[HybridFlow: A Flexible and Efficient RLHF Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19256v2)** paper.

verl is flexible and easy to use with:
- **Easy extension of diverse RL algorithms**: The hybrid-controller programming model enables flexible representation and efficient execution of complex post-training dataflows. Build RL dataflows such as GRPO, PPO in a few lines of code.
- **Seamless integration of existing LLM infra with modular APIs**: Decouples computation and data dependencies, enabling seamless integration with existing LLM frameworks, such as FSDP, Megatron-LM, vLLM, SGLang, etc
- **Flexible device mapping**: Supports various placement of models onto different sets of GPUs for efficient resource utilization and scalability across different cluster sizes.
- Ready integration with popular HuggingFace models

verl is fast with:
- **State-of-the-art throughput**: SOTA LLM training and inference engine integrations and SOTA RL throughput.
- **Efficient actor model resharding with 3D-HybridEngine**: Eliminates memory redundancy and significantly reduces communication overhead during transitions between training and generation phases.


## Key Features

- **FSDP**, **FSDP2** and **Megatron-LM** for training.
- **vLLM**, **SGLang** and **HF Transformers** for rollout generation.
- Compatible with Hugging Face Transformers and Modelscope Hub: [Qwen-3](https://github.com/volcengine/verl/blob/main/examples/grpo_trainer/run_qwen3-8b.sh), Qwen-2.5, Llama3.1, Gemma2, DeepSeek-LLM, etc
- Supervised fine-tuning.
- Reinforcement learning with [PPO](examples/ppo_trainer/), [GRPO](examples/grpo_trainer/), [ReMax](examples/remax_trainer/), [REINFORCE++](https://verl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/config.html#algorithm), [RLOO](examples/rloo_trainer/), [PRIME](recipe/prime/), [DAPO](recipe/dapo/), [DrGRPO](recipe/drgrpo), etc.
  - Support model-based reward and function-based reward (verifiable reward) for math, [coding](https://github.com/volcengine/verl/tree/main/recipe/dapo), etc
  - Support vision-language models (VLMs) and [multi-modal RL](examples/grpo_trainer/run_qwen2_5_vl-7b.sh) with Qwen2.5-vl, Kimi-VL
  - [Multi-turn with tool calling](https://github.com/volcengine/verl/tree/main/examples/sglang_multiturn)
- LLM alignment recipes such as [Self-play preference optimization (SPPO)](https://github.com/volcengine/verl/tree/main/recipe/sppo)
- Flash attention 2, [sequence packing](examples/ppo_trainer/run_qwen2-7b_seq_balance.sh), [sequence parallelism](examples/ppo_trainer/run_deepseek7b_llm_sp2.sh) support via DeepSpeed Ulysses, [LoRA](examples/sft/gsm8k/run_qwen_05_peft.sh), [Liger-kernel](examples/sft/gsm8k/run_qwen_05_sp2_liger.sh).
- Scales up to 671B models and hundreds of GPUs with [expert parallelism](https://github.com/volcengine/verl/pull/1467)
- Multi-gpu [LoRA RL](https://verl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advance/ppo_lora.html) support to save memory.
- Experiment tracking with wandb, swanlab, mlflow and tensorboard.
